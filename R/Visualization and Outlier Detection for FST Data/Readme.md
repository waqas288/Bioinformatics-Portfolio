Description:
R script to analyze and visualize genetic distance (FST) between ecotypes using ggplot2. Includes scatter plots by ecotype and country, with outlier detection based on 99% quantile.

Summary for README:
This R script reads FST data, classifies ecotypes, and visualizes genetic distances between short and long-winged ecotypes using scatter plots. It identifies outliers by calculating 95% and 99% quantiles of FST values. Requires ggplot2 for data visualization.
