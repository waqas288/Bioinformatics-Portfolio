This script is designed to evaluate potential associations between the presence of specific genetic variants and their effects on the expression levels of BMX and BRCA2, as well as on patient phenotype data.

1. Data Import and Structure Check
  The script begins by loading the dataset, examining the structure of the data, and confirming column names.

2. Chi-Squared Tests for Phenotype Association
   A chi-squared test is conducted on 2x2 contingency tables for the association between phenotype and the genotype of BMX and BRCA2 variants.

3. Linear Regression Analyses
   A linear regression is performed to assess if the BMX expression levels are affected by the rs139052738 genotype and whether BRCA2 expression levels are influenced by the rs886040801 genotype.
   The final model examines if BMX expression impacts BRCA2 expression.
