Description:
R script for analyzing gene expression data using Poisson regression. The script evaluates the impact of tissue type and patient ID on gene expression and visualizes the results with boxplots and histograms.

Summary for README:
This R script performs a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data by fitting Poisson regression models to assess the influence of tissue type and patient ID on gene expression levels. It generates boxplots of log2-transformed expression data, identifies problematic samples, and visualizes p-values through histograms. The script employs the tidyverse and MASS packages for data manipulation and statistical modeling, respectively. The results are illustrated using ggplot2 for enhanced visualization.
