Summary for README File
This R script conducts a detailed analysis of the relationship between mental health diagnoses, disability scores, and quality of life metrics using mixed-effects models. It reads a dataset, performs model fitting for different diagnoses (including Depression, Dementia, Psychosis, and others), extracts confidence intervals and estimates, and generates visualizations to illustrate changes in disability scores and quality of life dimensions. The script employs libraries such as lme4 for linear mixed models and ggplot2 for creating informative plots, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of how various factors influence disability and quality of life in individuals with mental health conditions.
